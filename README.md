### Getting and Cleaning Data project

To run the script, download the run_analysis.R, features.txt, and the test and train directories, then run the run_analysis() function in that file.  It will generate files call data_set_1.csv and data_set_2.csv.  Currently, it only generates a partial data file for the second file due to time contraints.  If you want the whole file, edit line 38 to say "3:length(names(allx))" instead of "3:15."
